        Vaioti is basically a digital network for connecting the various shops in India. It allows customers to access all the details of any shop in India whichever is conneted through this network.<br>
        VAIOTI began its journey from hamirpur , himachal pradesh and since then it has proved to be a very benefiacial app for people. Almost all the buisnesses in Hamirpur are connected to VAIOTI at present. One of the example for the benefits of VAIOTI is the reduction of the fare of taxis for the route of hamirpur bus stand to NIT hamirpur.
